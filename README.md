## MAVLAB wing file format
 
The following outlines the basic structure of MAVLAB wing file auto-generated by MAVLAB.  Descriptions of what each parameter does are in my thesis.  Each parameter is stored in a structure variable, in this case named “wing.”  See Matlab documentation on how to create/modify structure (or struct) type variables.  

```matlab
wing =
 
       span: 24
      chord: 7
     camber: 0.0600
        tip: 0.2500
      twist: 0
      sweep: 0
   dihedral: 0
    edgeref: 0
     mirror: 1
   planform: [1x1 struct]
      foils: [1x1 struct]
        ind: 1
          X: [] % <-  ""
          Y: [] % <-  Not input parameters. They store outputs.
          Z: [] % <-  ""
```

## Parameters

### Span
 
The wing span (Scalar value). See thesis for more detail.
 
### Chord
 
### The root chord dimension (Scalar value).  See thesis for more detail
 
### Camber
 
The camber refers to the maximum camber of the airfoil cross section.  It is typically described by a percentage.  MAVLAB uses the decimal form (Scalar value).
 
### Tip
 
The tip is the height the wing tip will be from level (scalar value).  This is essentially a value used to scale the z-component of the planform shape, described later. See thesis for more detail.
 
### Twist
 
The twist is the span-wise twist of the wing in degrees (scalar value). Positive angles create washout.
 
### Sweep
 
The sweep is the ¼ chord sweep angle in degrees (scalar value).  See thesis for more detail.
 
### Dihedral
 
The dihedral is the angle the wing makes with a horizontal planar surface.  This is a specific form of span-shape, but is included as a scalar value because it is so commonly used in wing designs.
 
### Edgeref
 
The edgeref is a Boolean value to modify the wing in such a way that the maximum cambers of the wing are aligned (edgref = false).  Otherwise the z-values of the wing are aligned with the planform leading edge (edgeref = true).
 
### Mirror
 
Mirror determines whether or not the wing should be mirrored about the y-axis (downstream) (mirror = true) or only half of the wing should be considered (mirror = false).
 
 
### Planform
 
The wing “planform” parameter is further broken down into another structure with parameters “Ledge” and “Tedge,” for leading and trailing edge of the wing planform, respectively.  Note that the coordinates assume a symmetric wing and therefore it is only necessary to define the semi-span with the root starting at X=0;
 

Wing.planform =
 
   Ledge: [1x1 struct] % Coordinates for leading edge
   Tedge: [1x1 struct] % Coordinates for Trailing edge
 
Each leading and trailing edge parameter is again broken down into x,y,z values which are all vectors of an arbitrary, but same length.  In this case they are all 1 by 20.  
 
The relative directions of these components are as follows
X – Out the right wing
Y – Downstream
Z - Up
 
```matlab
wing.planform.Ledge =
 
   x: [1x20 double]
   y: [1x20 double]
   z: [1x20 double]

 
% One example might be to set all the z-values to zero.  We can do this by typing:
 
wing.planform.Ledge.z = zeros(1,20);
wing.planform.Tedge.z = zeros(1,20);
 
% Notice that it would have been incorrect to type:
 
wing.planform.Ledge.z = 0;
wing.planform.Tedge.z = 0;

% This is wrong because all components must have the same length for the leading and trailing edge.

```
 
Reminder, the planform is defined as the right portion of a semi-span.
 
 
### Foils
 
The foils refers to the airfoils.  Currently, MAVLAB can support two airfoils (wing root and tip).  These are defined in vector form, similar to the planform.

```matlab
wing.foils.x: [41x2 double]
wing.foils.y: [41x2 double]
 
The x and y components should be n by 2 arrays.  The first column of each corresponds to the root airfoil and the second corresponds to the tip.
 
Example:
 
wing.foils.x =
 
        0         0
   0.0250    0.0250
   0.0500    0.0500
   0.0750    0.0750
      :         :
      :         :
   0.9250    0.9250
   0.9500    0.9500
   0.9750    0.9750
   1.0000    1.0000

```

### Ind
 
Ind is a vector corresponding to the place along the span where each airfoil in “wing.foils” is located.  Since MAVLAB currently only supports up to two airfoils, this can be 1 of 3 things. For a wing with 20 stations along its semi-span and two different airfoils:

```matlab
wing.ind: [1 20]
 
% For the same wing with only one airfoil:
 
wing.ind = 1
 
% Again for the same with only one airfoil, but the wing shall be formed in such a way that is similar to projecting the planform onto a singly curved surface:
 
Wing.ind = []
```
 
 
 
### Important routines to know how to use from the command line
 
```matlab
% dcBuild
 
[X,Y,Z] = dcBuild(wing);
 
% This returns the surface in a matrix form that is commonly used in Matlab routines such as “surf(X,Y,Z)” or “mesh(X,Y,Z)”
 
[X,Y,Z] = dcBuild(wing,N/2) % where N modifies the number of span-wise stations of the wing.
 
%dcAVL
 
dcAVL(wing) % will launch a GUI that is a wrapper for AVL (Athena Vorex Lattice) CFD.  See thesis for more documentation.
 
 
% dcCNC
 
dcCNC(wing) % will launch a GUI that allows the user to create and export a toolpath for the SERVO CNC machine at the University of Florida Machine shop. *Note: if a different machine is required for milling, modifications will have to be made to “cncpost.m”.  
 
 
% nrbWing
 
nrb = nrbWing(wing) will create a struct variable defining a NURBS surface for the wing.  This is the typical representation of a surface in most CAD programs.
 
 
% Igesout
 
igesout(nrb,filename) % will export the wing to an IGES file that can be read by most CAD programs (such as Mechanical Desktop, ProE, Mastercam, Solid Works, etc).  Exporting to IGES and opening in Mastercam is the preferred method for CNC applications involving a milling machine other than SERVO.
